Idea for how slideshow would work:

on document ready, append slides.length number of imgs (and set src) into #slideshow, set
z-index to -1 and opacity to 0 on each except slide 0, which should have
z-index 0 and opacity 1.

setinterval:
	set slide #(currSlide + 1) to z-index: 0, slide #currSlide to z-index:
-1, and fade_in currSlide
	bind animationend:
		if there is a user-selected slide:
			set currSlide to that slide
			clear interval
			restart interval
			reset user-selected slide
